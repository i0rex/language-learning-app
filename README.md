This project was my final project for my studies, focusing on creating a language-learning app designed to help users learn full sentences. The app provides an engaging way to improve language skills through various features:

Features

Multilingual Sentence Database: Sentences are stored in an SQLite database and are available in multiple languages.
Audio Playback: Each sentence can be played as an audio file for listening practice.
Dialogues: Interactive dialogues help users practice real-life conversations.
Training Area: A dedicated section for focused sentence training and learning.
Statistics: Track progress with detailed statistics, including completed lessons and overall performance.

Technologies Used

SQLite Database for storing and retrieving multilingual sentences.
Audio Playback Functionality for aural learning.
Java for app development.
This app aims to provide a practical and fun tool for language learners to master sentence structures and improve their speaking and listening skills.
